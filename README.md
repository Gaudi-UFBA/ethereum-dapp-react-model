# Blockchain & React dapp model

This is a blockchain dapp (Decentralized Application) model using React.js and Web3.js. In this model I'm using the Web3.js to communicate with the Ethereum blockchain. I also created a simple Smart Contract using Solidity language as an example only to show the process of compiling and deploying a Smart Contract. The objective of this repository is to offer a dapp model that has almost all tools needed to create a website integrating React.js and Web3.js in order to facilitate the creation of a dapp.
